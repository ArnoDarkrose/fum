Thank you for using Fum, a terminal-based media player. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains how Fum interacts with Google APIs and handles user data. 
1. Information We Collect  

Fum is designed to provide a seamless terminal-based media playback experience. Importantly, Fum does not collect, store, or share any personal data  from its users. The app operates locally on your device and does not transmit any information to external servers or third parties. 

However, when you use Fum to interact with Google APIs (e.g., liking or disliking a currently playing video), the following may occur: 

- Google API Interactions : When you choose to "like" or "dislike" a video, Fum sends a request to Google's API to perform this action. This interaction is handled directly between your device and Google's servers.
- No Additional Data Collection : Fum does not collect or store any information about your interactions with Google APIs. All actions (e.g., liking or disliking) are processed by Google, and Fum does not retain any logs or records of these actions.
     

2. How Your Data is Used  

Fum does not use, process, or store any personal data. Any interaction with Google APIs (e.g., liking or disliking videos) is performed in accordance with Google's terms and policies. Google may record and handle these interactions as part of their standard operations, but Fum itself does not access or store any additional data. 

3. Data Sharing  

Fum does not share any user data with third parties. Since the app does not collect or store any personal information, there is no data to share. 

4. Compliance with Google API Policies  

Fum integrates with Google APIs to allow users to "like" or "dislike" videos. By using Fum, you agree to comply with Google's [API Services User Data Policy ](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy). Please note that Google may independently collect and process data related to your interactions with their services. 

5. Security  

Since Fum does not collect or store any personal data, there is no risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. However, we encourage you to keep your device secure and ensure that your Google account credentials are protected. 

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy  

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through the application or other appropriate means. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices.
